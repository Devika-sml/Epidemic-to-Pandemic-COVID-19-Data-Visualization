## Sample Map

## Overview
An attempt to visualise the outbreak of COVID-19 on India map and Kerala map, State wise and District wise respectively.

## Motivation
As cases of Covid-19 proliferate across the globe, so has data associated with it. I have seen data represented in different format. I want to display how effectively one can communicate the message visually through a map of their district or country and how they are affected by COVID-19. 

## Data Description
For the visualization we need to scrap data from websites. 
*	Current status of COVID-19 for various states in India and various districts in Kerala from Wikipedia using Python
*	Latitude and longitude coordinates of India, states, and districts of Kerala.

## Technical Aspect
*	This code has been written in __Jupyter notebook__
*	__Python__
*	Data Visualization using __Folium__ (Python Library)
